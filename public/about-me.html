<p>Hello, my name is Eric Rodriguez and I was born in the vibrant and culturally rich country of Cuba, where I spent the first 14 years of my life. In 2018, my family and I embarked on a new journey, moving to the United States. This transition marked a significant change in my life, bringing new challenges and opportunities. Adjusting to a new country, learning a new language, and making new friends have all been part of my incredible journey of growth and self-discovery.</p>

<p>After arriving in the US, I dedicated myself to my education, culminating in my high school graduation. Currently, I am pursuing a degree in computer science, a field that fascinates me with its endless possibilities for innovation and problem-solving. The ever-evolving nature of technology excites me, and I am eager to contribute to this dynamic field. My studies have not only enhanced my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of how technology can improve lives and drive change.</p>

<p>Outside of my academic pursuits, I enjoy staying active and spending quality time with my loved ones. Going to the gym is one of my favorite activities, providing a perfect balance to my studies and helping me maintain a healthy lifestyle. Whether it's lifting weights, running, or trying out new workouts, the gym is a place where I can challenge myself and unwind. Additionally, I cherish moments spent with family and friends, as they bring joy, support, and inspiration into my life. Balancing my passions and commitments is important to me, and I am grateful for the experiences and people that shape who I am today.</p>
